Assignment 1: Web Development
Submission Date: 8th April, 2017


In my webpages everything is aligned well. The font in bio page looks abit small that I have found a bit bad.  Other things are organized well like the colours, backgrounds etc. 

The divs in footer were not aligned properly which was helped by my tutor Mr. Ganesh Khatri. Other things are done by myself. I didn't collaborated or disscussed my assignment with others.

I used to spend 2/3 hours daily to design my webpages. When the deadline was near I spent more hours like 5/6 hours a day for a week.
